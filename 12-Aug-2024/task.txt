Hi Imanuel,

If you would like some practice, I would recommend having a go at the following tasks. Pick and choose whichever you would like to do:

-Implement an add_relationship() method to the animal class, that takes both the animal and the relationship type and adds this to the vector.

-Implement a get_animals_of_relationship() method that takes a relationship type and returns all the animals of that type of relationship. (might be difficult, let me know if you need help here)

-Implement a describe() method, that simply outputs to the console all the properties and values of the animal object. This is useful for future debugging purposes.

-Create another constructor alongside the default one for easier initialization of the member values.

-Test all the code written, make sure it works correctly.


Pairs are easy to construct like vectors, using curly braces and will fit into the correct context where needed, for example as function arguments. Eg:

animalrelationships.push_back({animal, rel_type});
